                    Ford Village has no railroad station, being on the other side of the 
                    river from Porter's Falls, and accessible only by the ford which gives 
                    it its name, and a ferry line. The ferry-boat was waiting when Rebecca 
                    Flint got off the train with her bag and lunch basket. When she and her 
                    small trunk were safely embarked she sat stiff and straight and calm in 
                    the ferry-boat as it shot swiftly and smoothly across stream. There was a 
                    horse attached to a light country wagon on board, and he pawed the deck 
                    uneasily. His owner stood near, with a wary eye upon him, although he was 
                    chewing, with as dully reflective an expression as a cow. Beside Rebecca 
                    sat a woman of about her own age, who kept looking at her with furtive 
                    curiosity; her husband, short and stout and saturnine, stood near her. 
                    Rebecca paid no attention to either of them. She was tall and spare and 
                    pale, the type of a spinster, yet with rudimentary lines and expressions 
                    of matronhood. She all unconsciously held her shawl, rolled up in a canvas 
                    bag, on her left hip, as if it had been a child. She wore a settled frown of 
                    dissent at life, but it was the frown of a mother who regarded life as a 
                    froward child, rather than as an overwhelming fate.
